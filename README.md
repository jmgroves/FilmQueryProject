***** README FOR FILM QUERY DATABASE PROJECT******


STRUCTURE: The program is ran by the driver class, FilmQueryApp. Through which, my simple DAO is able to retrieve information from the MySQL database and store it in an appropriate object to be collected or printed out to the user.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: In this project, I used Java for the backend work and a MySQL database containing all the tables needed. It was definitely a challenge to correctly enter in the queries to get back out exactly what I wanted, but in the end I was able to take it on!

CHALLENGES: The biggest challenge for me was both inputting the correct queries and also storing the information to the correct objects in order to retrieve it later. ATOM was very helpful for typing out the queries so I can more easily format them before trying them dry in the MySQL terminal before finally coding them into the DAO.
